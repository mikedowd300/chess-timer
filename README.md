Chess timer

This is what it looks like. Its a chess timer essesintialy, but it has an added feature of counting moves. Works great on mobile as far as I have seen. I have been advised that there should be a built in 5 second delay, or maybe 5 seconds should be added onto the time left for each turn. It wouldn't be hard to do that with the current code but personally I don't like it. I think it would be better to give the user the choice with an options page which could give users the power for that as well as color schemes, whether or not they want to see the move counter or whatever.
